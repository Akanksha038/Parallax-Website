# Parallax-Website
This is a Parallax website

Parallax scrolling is a web design technique where background images move at a slower rate than foreground images,
creating an illusion of depth and immersion as users scroll down a webpage.
This effect can be visually stunning and is often used to enhance storytelling and engage visitors.
